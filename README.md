This challenge starts with using BeautifulSoup to scrape data from two sites, including [Mars News](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html) and [Mars Weather](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html). After web scraping, the data is stored into json file and pandas dataframe for data analysis. In Mars Weather, the weather data is analysed and visualized using matplotlib.
